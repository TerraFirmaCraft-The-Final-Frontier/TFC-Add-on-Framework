# TFC Add-on Framework

A mod framework to streamline TFC add-on development with cross-add-on compatibility through dynamically generated assets.

Currently supports the dynamic registration of wooden, metal and rock objects, blockstates and language files, abiding by the TFC registry.

Requires [TerraFirmaCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfcraft) and [Resource Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resource-loader) by default.
